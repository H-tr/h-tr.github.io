        <h2>Your Life's midpoint is 18</h2>
        <p>
          If you're past 18, you've already lived more than half your life—subjectively.
          The years from 4 to 18 feel as long as the years from 18 to 80. 
          Not because time literally changes, but because of how we experience it.

          This is a very interesting idea from the following two videos. They're in Chinese, but the visuals are pretty self-explanatory:

                  "世界是对数的……吗？" — why log-ish effects show up everywhere
                </p>

            </div>
          </div>
        
        <p>
          Why does time seem to accelerate? The standard answer is <strong>logarithmic time perception</strong>: 
          our subjective experience of time follows a logarithmic scale rather than a linear one. 
          A year at age 10 feels much longer than a year at age 50, because on a log scale, the "distance" 
          from 10 to 11 is far greater than from 50 to 51.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a simple consequence: if subjective time is logarithmic, when do you reach the midpoint of your life? 
          Not at 40. To find the subjective midpoint between ages \(a\) and \(b\), we solve:
          \[
          \log(m) - \log(a) = \log(b) - \log(m) \implies m = \sqrt{a \cdot b}
          \]
          If conscious memory starts around age 4 and you live to 80, then \(m = \sqrt{4 \times 80} = \sqrt{320} \approx 18\). Half your subjective life is over before you finish high school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why does this logarithmic pattern appear? Network science offers a clue. When a new node 
          joins a network, it connects preferentially to well-connected nodes. The probability of 
          connecting to node \(i\) is proportional to its current degree:
          \[
          \Pi(k_i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_j k_j}
          \]
          Larger hubs attract more connections, becoming even larger. This "rich get richer" dynamic 
          produces a <strong>power law distribution</strong>: \(P(k) \propto k^{-\gamma}\). Unlike 
          normal distributions, power laws have long tails: a few nodes dominate with many connections, 
          while most have few.
        </p>

        <figure class="inline-figure">
          <img src="/media/images/blog/review-budget/long-tail-distribution.svg" alt="Log-log plot comparing power law and normal distributions" class="distribution-svg" />
          <figcaption>In log-log scale, power law appears as a straight line while normal drops sharply. The shaded region shows the "long tail" where power law persists.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Network Science of our Memory</h3>
        <p>
          Now apply this to our memory. If we consider each new event as a node, it connects to existing memories: 
          comparing, relating, anchoring. A child with few stored experiences can encode a new event 
          with little overhead. An adult with decades of memories must link each new moment to a 
          vast existing network. More attention flows to integration; less remains for the experience 
          itself. The present shrinks. Time accelerates.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this blog, we define this integration process as <strong>replay</strong>.
        <p>
          Running conversations again. Re-living proud moments. Feeling regret. 
          Comparing today to childhood. Rewriting decisions that can't be changed.
          It leaks into walking, showering, commuting, staring at the ceiling, pretending to listen.
        </p>
        <p>
          How much of today did you spend replaying yesterday—or five years ago?
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't have a clean answer. But I want to sketch a model and see what falls out.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Can we formulate this phenomenon into a graphical model?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>From this formulation, can we derive how much time to spend reviewing, and what to review?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Can we extend this to decision-making, and how might we test it?</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Formulation and modeling</h2>
        <p>
          The underlying system here (brain + environment + memory) is highly complex and far from linear, but our <em>observations</em> still arrive sequentially.
          So it makes sense to start from a sequential decision-making framework, and a POMDP is a powerful choice for writing that down.
          I'm going to use it mainly to fix notation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A POMDP is the tuple
          \[
          \mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{O}, T, Z, R, \gamma).
          \]
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>States</strong> \(\mathcal{S}\): latent states \(s_t \in \mathcal{S}\).</li>
          <li><strong>Actions</strong> \(\mathcal{A}\): actions \(a_t \in \mathcal{A}\).</li>
          <li><strong>Observations</strong> \(\mathcal{O}\): observations \(o_t \in \mathcal{O}\).</li>
          <li><strong>Transition model</strong> \(T(s' \mid s,a)\): dynamics \(s_{t+1} \sim T(\cdot \mid s_t, a_t)\).</li>
          <li><strong>Observation model</strong> \(Z(o \mid s,a)\) (often \(Z(o \mid s)\)): emissions \(o_{t} \sim Z(\cdot \mid s_t, a_{t-1})\).</li>
          <li><strong>Reward</strong> \(R(s,a)\): scalar reward \(r_t = R(s_t, a_t)\).</li>
          <li><strong>Discount</strong> \(\gamma \in [0,1)\): time preference over future rewards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Since the state is hidden, we track a <strong>belief</strong> \(b_t(s) = \mathbb{P}(s_t=s \mid h_t)\), where the history
          \(h_t = (o_1,a_1,\dots,o_t)\). After action \(a_t\) and a new observation \(o_{t+1}\), the belief update is:
          \[
          b_{t+1}(s') = \eta \, Z(o_{t+1}\mid s', a_t)\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}} T(s'\mid s, a_t)\, b_t(s),
          \]
          with normalizer \(\eta\).
        </p>
        <p>
          A (history- or belief-based) policy \(\pi\) selects actions, e.g. \(a_t \sim \pi(\cdot \mid b_t)\). The usual objective is:
          \[
          \max_{\pi}\; \mathbb{E}_{\pi}\Big[\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\gamma^{t-1} R(s_t, a_t)\Big].
          \]
        </p>

        <h2>Review Policy</h2>

        <h2>Decision Making</h2>

        <h2>Takeaways and Discussion</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Is “review time” growing with age, or does it only feel that way?</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What's the right objective for replay?</strong> (fast learning? happiness? calibration?)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Are we overfitting to the tail?</strong> Do a few rare events dominate the policy update?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What's the analogue of "replay buffer size" in humans?</strong> sleep? journaling? therapy?
          </li>
        </ul>
